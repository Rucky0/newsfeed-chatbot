$2.9B non -GAAP net income1in Q1In the current macroeconomic environment, we see this year as a unique 
opportunity for Tesla. As many carmakers are working through challenges with the 
unit economics of their EV programs, we aim to leverage our position as a cost 
leader. We are focused on rapidly growing production, investments in autonomy 
and vehicle software, and remaining on track with our growth investments.
Our near -term pricing strategy considers a long -term view on per vehicle 
profitability given the potential lifetime value of a Tesla vehicle through autonomy, 
supercharging, connectivity and service. We expect that our product pricing will 
continue to evolve, upwards or downwards, depending on a number of factors.
Although we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions 
in the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate. We 
expect ongoing cost reduction of our vehicles, including improved production 
efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and remain focused on 
operating leverage as we scale.
We are rapidly growing energy storage production capacity at our Megafactory in 
Lathrop and we recently announced a new Megafactory in Shanghai. We are also 
continuing to execute on our product roadmap, including Cybertruck, our next 
generation vehicle platform, autonomy and other AI enabled products.  
Our balance sheet and net income enable us to continue to make these capital 
expenditures in line with our future growth. In this environment, we believe it 
makes sense to push forward to ensure we lay a proper foundation for the best 
possible future.Cash Operating cash flow of $2.5B

Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM)
Source: Tesla estimates based on ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM –light-duty vehicles only
TTM = Trailing twelve months7
In Q1, we produced a record number of vehicles, thanks to ongoing ramps at our 
factories in Austin and Berlin. We remain committed to reducing the percentage of 
vehicles delivered in the 3rdmonth and smoothing deliveries throughout the quarter, 
which will help to reduce cost per vehicle, while increasing in -transit inventory at the 
end of each quarter.
US: California, Nevada and Texas
The Model Y was the best -selling non- pickup vehicle in the US in Q1. We showcased 
4680 cell production at our March -2023 Investor Day; production rate continued to 
improve sequentially in Q1. Equipment installation for Cybertruck production at 
Gigafactory Texas continued in Q1 and remains on track. 
China: Shanghai
Since our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for 
several months, we do not expect meaningful increase of weekly production run 
rate. We launched sales in Thailand, a new market supplied out of Shanghai. Thus far, 
the reception has been very positive. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub.
Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg
The Model Y production line in Germany produced over 5,000 vehicles in a week 
towards the end of Q1. In Q1 -2023, Tesla Model Y became the best -selling vehicle, of 
any kind, in Europe (EU + EFTA + UK)*.

Global Model 3 cost normalized* Autopilot and Full Self -Driving (FSD)
Our growing fleet of FSD Beta users has an exponential impact on total FSD Beta 
miles driven – with over 150 million miles to date and counting. This level of data 
collection is unprecedented in the industry. Mass collection of diverse datasets is essential for AI -based approach – the only approach we believe can work for scalable 
autonomy. In Q1, we enabled the latest FSD Beta software stack for highway driving.
Vehicle and Other Software
While our various vehicles provide different range, acceleration or vehicle size, we believe the Tesla software experience is the best -in-class across all vehicles. Even the 
base Model 3 offers seamless integration of vehicle controls, safety and security features (sentry mode, dog mode) and a full suite of connectivity and entertainment features (Spotify , other music streaming services, video streaming, 4G, etc.), and 
ongoing software updates bring yet more functionality over time. Recently, we 
launched home -
grown Recruitment and Employee Health & Safety platforms as part of 
the broader Tesla OS ecosystem. More details on page 12.
Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing
Producing electric vehicles profitably is a challenging endeavor. It requires rethinking 
how vehicles are designed and produced from the ground up. Our cost journey is nowhere near finished, which is why we recently announced transition to 48 Volt architecture for vehicle electronics (starting with Cybertruck), higher penetration of in-house designed controllers, cheaper, more scalable drive units and further 
innovations in the manufacturing process. Cost reduction remains the main enabler of 
delivering on our mission. ~30% decline

9Services & Other gross margin
Energy Storage deployments (GWh)Energy Storage
Energy storage deployments increased by 360% YoY in Q1 to 3.9 GWh, the highest 
level of deployments we have achieved due to ongoing Megafactory ramp. The ramp of our 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California has been successful with still more room to reach full capacity. This Megapack factory will be the first of many. We recently announced our second 40 GWh Megafactory, this time in Shanghai, with construction starting later this year. 
Solar
Solar deployments increased by 40% YoY in Q1 to 67 MW, but declined sequentially in 
the quarter, predominantly due to volatile weather and other factors. In addition, the solar industry has been impacted by supply chain challenges.
Services and Other
Both revenue and gross profit from Services and Other reached an all -time high in Q1 
2023. Within this business division, growth of used vehicle sales remained strong YoY and had healthy margins. Supercharging, while still a relatively small part of the business, continued to grow as we gradually open up the network to non- Tesla 
vehicles.

10Volume We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding 
to in early 2021.  In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors.  
For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long -term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million cars for the year.
Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. 
Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we 
expect our hardware -related profits to be accompanied with an acceleration of software- related profits. We continue 
to believe that our operating margin will remain among the highest in the industry.
Product Cybertruck remains on track to begin production later this year at Gigafactory Texas. In addition, we continue to make 
progress on our next generation platform. P H O T O S   &   C H A R T S

NON -GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income 
(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as 
well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information 
internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial 
condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s 
performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding 
Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.

$2.7B GAAP net income
$3.1B non -GAAP net income1Q2-2023 was a record quarter on many levels with our best -ever 
production and deliveries and revenue approaching $25B in a single 
quarter. We are excited that we were able to achieve such results given 
the macroeconomic environment we are currently in. 
Our operating margin remained healthy at approximately 10%, even with 
price reductions in Q1 and early Q2. This reflects our ongoing cost 
reduction efforts, the continued production ramp success in Berlin and Texas and the strong performance of our Energy and Services & Other businesses.
Our commitment to being at the forefront of AI development entered a 
new chapter with the start of production of Dojo training computers. We are hopeful that our immense neural net training needs will be satisfied 
using our in- house designed Dojo hardware. The better the neural net 
training capacity, the greater the opportunity for our Autopilot team to 
iterate on new solutions. 
In conclusion, we are focusing on cost reduction, new product 
development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better 
vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow. The challenges of these uncertain times are not over, but we believe we have the right ingredients for the long -term 
success of the business through a variety of high potential projects. Cash Operating cash flow of $3.1B

5Revenue Total revenue grew 47% YoY in Q2 to $24.9B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
+ growth in vehicle deliveries
+ growth in other parts of the business
-reduced ASP YoY (excluding FX impact)
-negative FX impact of $0.6B1
Profitability Our operating income decreased slightly YoY to $2.4B in Q2, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin. YoY, operating 
income was primarily impacted by the following items:
-reduced ASP due to mix and pricing
-cost of production ramp of 4680 cells and other related charges
-increase in Operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other large projects
-negative FX impact
+ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite margin headwind from underutilization of new factories)
+ lower cost per vehicle, which includes lower raw material costs and IRA credit
+ gross profit growth in Energy business as well as Services & Other
Other income (below operating income line) was positively impacted by FX movements on certain intercompany balances.
Cash Quarter -end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $0.7B to $23.1B in Q2, driven mainly by free 
cash flow of $1.0B, partially offset by other financing activities, including debt repayments.

In Q2, we produced a record number of vehicles, thanks to ongoing ramps of our 
new factories as well as strong performance of Shanghai and Fremont. We remain 
committed to smoothing deliveries throughout the quarter by reducing the 
percentage of vehicles delivered in the 3rd month . Vehicles in- transit, test -drive and 
display vehicles account for a substantive majority of our total days of supply.
US: California, Nevada and Texas
At Gigafactory Texas, in addition to the continued success of the Model Y ramp, we 
are also working on equipment installation for Cybertruck production, which remains 
on track for initial deliveries this year. We have made notable progress on yield 
improvement of our 4680 cell production lines. We continue building capacity for 
cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. 
China: Shanghai
Since our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for 
several months, we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run 
rate. Gigafactory Shanghai remains our main export hub.
Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg
Our factory in Germany produced standard range Model Y vehicles in Q2 for the first 
time. Building off momentum from its success in Q1, Model Y was the best -selling 
vehicle of any kind in Europe year- to-date (based on the latest available data as of

Internal projection of Dojo compute powerArtificial Intelligence Software and Hardware
Four main technology pillars are needed to solve vehicle autonomy at scale: extremely 
large real -world dataset, neural net training, vehicle hardware and vehicle software. 
We are developing each of these pillars in -house. This month, we are taking a step 
towards faster and cheaper neural net training with the start of production of our Dojo 
training computer. 
Vehicle and Other Software
For customers getting a Model 3 or Y for the first time, we launched the “Get To Know 
Your Tesla” experience where users can adjust their seats, mirrors, steering wheel, set 
up the phone key and learn about topics such as regenerative braking. To help 
customers discover ongoing improvements in software updates, we now highlight 
new features directly in the UI, encourage users to try features they may have missed and added the ability to search Controls. 
Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing
We are now testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for final certification and 
validation. This might be the most unique vehicle product in decades; with that comes 
trialing and testing new technologies. As far as we know, Cybertruck will be the first sub-19 ft. truck (fitting into a garage) that has both four doors and 6+ ft. bed. Both 
technologically and architecturally, this vehicle will break a lot of boundaries –very 
much in line with how we think about vehicle engineering and manufacturing. 050100150200250300350

Energy Storage deployments (GWh)Energy Storage
Energy storage deployments increased by 222% YoY in Q2 to 3.7 GWh, another strong 
quarter due to the ongoing ramp of our first dedicated Megapack factory 
(Megafactory) in Lathrop, CA. The ramp of this 40 GWh Megafactory –the first of 
many -has been successful with still more room to reach full capacity. While energy 
storage deployment rate can be volatile due to project timing, production rate 
improved further sequentially in Q2. 
Solar
Solar deployments remained roughly flat sequentially at 66 MW, declining YoY, 
predominantly due to a high interest rate environment that is causing postponement of solar purchasing industry -wide. 
Services and Other business 
The 2ndquarter of 2023 has been the quarter of Supercharging. A significant number 
of companies, including Ford, GM, Mercedes, Nissan, Polestar, Rivian, Volvo and 
Electrify America, have announced adoption of NACS – a charging standard 
developed by Tesla over a decade ago – for their North American products. Further 
opening our charging network in 2024 will enable both faster market conversion from 
combustion vehicles to EVs as well as faster growth of our charging network through 
a larger addressable fleet.01234

10Volume We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to 
in early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 
2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long -term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.
Cash We have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. 
Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect 
our hardware -related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. 
Product Cybertruck remains on track to begin initial production later this year at Gigafactory Texas. In addition, we continue to 
make progress on our next generation platform. P H O T O S   &   C H A R T S

NON -GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income 
(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as 
well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information 
internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial 
condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s 
performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding 
Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.

$1.9B GAAP net income in Q3
$2.3B non -GAAP net income1 in Q3Our main objectives remained unchanged in Q3 -2023: reducing cost per 
vehicle, free cash flow generation while maximizing delivery volumes and 
continued investment in AI and other growth projects.
Our cost of goods sold per vehicle4decreased to ~$37,500 in Q3. While 
production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established 
factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable 
further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader.
During a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while 
maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year -to-date, 
our free cash flow reached $2.3B while our cash and 
investments position continues to improve.
We have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard -coded software, and its hardware is being 
further upgraded.
Lastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over $0.5B in Q3, our 
Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business 
have become meaningful contributors to our profitability.Cash Operating cash flow of $3.3B in Q3

TTM = Trailing twelve months7
During the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at 
various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made 
further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September 
accounting for ~40% of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting 
for ~65% of Q3 deliveries in 2022.
US: California, Nevada and Texas
At Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains 
on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate 
in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply 
chain needs in a cost -efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is 
progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production 
and lithium refining in the U.S.
China: Shanghai
Other than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully 
running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful 
increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub.
Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg
Model Y remained the best -selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year -to-date (based 
on the latest available data as of August). Similar to Texas, further production ramp 
of Model Y will be gradual.0%1%2%3%4%US/Canada Europe ChinaCost of goods sold per vehicleC O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y

Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware
Software that safely performs tasks in the real world is the key focus of our AI 
development efforts. We have commissioned one of the world's largest 
supercomputers to accelerate the pace of our AI development, with compute capacity 
more than doubling compared to Q2. Our large installed base of vehicles continues to generate anonymized video and other data used to develop our FSD Capability features.
Vehicle and Other Software
All Tesla rentals through Hertz in the U.S. and Canada now allow Tesla app access, allowing renters to use keyless lock/unlock via phone key, remotely precondition the cabin, track charge status and more. Customers who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental car feel like their own. The in- app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to 
schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage drop -
off/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a 
demo vehicle.
Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing
Despite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and 
ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was ~$37,500, and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will 
adopt an 800 -volt architecture.0100200300400500600

Energy Storage
Energy storage deployments increased by 90% YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest 
quarterly deployment ever. Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3.
Solar
Solar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand.
Services and Other business
As our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow 
successfully, with Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core 
drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay -per-use Supercharging remains a profitable business 
for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures. Our team is focused on materially expanding Supercharging capacity and further improving capacity management in anticipation of other OEMs joining our network.01234

10Volume We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to 
in early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 
2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long -term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.
Cash We have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. 
Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect 
our hardware -related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. 
Product Cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next 
generation platform. P H O T O S   &   C H A R T S

NON -GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income 
(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as 
well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information 
internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial

release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assetsIn 2023, we delivered over 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the best -selling vehicle, 
of any kind, globally. For a long time, many doubted the viability of EVs. Today, the 
best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV.
Free cash flow remained strong in 2023 at $4.4B, even as we focused on future 
growth projects with our highest capital expenditures and R&D expenses in 
company history.
Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023, more than double 
compared to the previous year, while Energy Generation and Storage business 
profits nearly quadrupled in 2023. Gross profit of our Services & Other business 
increased from a ~$500M loss in 2019 to a ~$500M profit in 2023.
Cost of goods sold per vehicle5 declined sequentially in Q4. Our team remains 
focused on growing our output, investing in our future growth and finding 
additional cost efficiencies in 2024.
In late December, we started rolling out V12 of FSD Beta6. Trained on data from a 
fleet of over a million vehicles, this system uses AI to influence vehicle controls 
(steering wheel, pedals, indicators, etc.) instead of hard -coding every driving 
behavior. V12 marks a new era in the path to full autonomy.
We are focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as 
we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas. This platform will 
revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.Cash Operating cash flow of $13.3B; free cash flow2 of $4.4B in 2023

6Revenue Total revenue grew 3% YoY in Q4 to $25.2B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
+ growth in vehicle deliveries
+ growth in other parts of the business
+ positive FX impact of $0.1B1
- reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) YoY (excl. FX impact), including unfavorable impact of mix
- lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22
Profitability Our operating income decreased YoY to $2.1B in Q4, resulting in an 8.2% operating margin. YoY, operating income was 
primarily impacted by the following items:
- reduced vehicle ASP due to pricing and mix
- increase in operating expenses partly driven by AI and other R&D projects
- lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22
- cost of Cybertruck production ramp
+ lower cost per vehicle, including lower raw material costs, logistics costs and IRA credit benefit 
+ growth in vehicle deliveries 
+ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage
While it did not impact Operating Income, we did record a one -time non- cash tax benefit of $5.9B in Q4 for the release of 
valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
Cash Quarter -end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $3.0B to $29.1B in Q4, driven by free cash 
flow of $2.1B and financing activities of $0.9B.

After our scheduled global factory shutdown in Q3, our global production reached 
a record annualized run rate of nearly 2.0 million vehicles in Q4. The refreshed 
Model 3 - with a significantly quieter cabin, ventilated seats, a screen for rear seats, 
longer range and many other improvements - is now available globally. 
US: California, Nevada and Texas
Before Tesla purchased the Fremont factory, the record output of the previous 
owner was nearly 430,000 vehicles made in a single year. In 2023, the Tesla 
Fremont factory produced nearly 560,000 vehicles thanks to our ~20,000 Fremont -
based employees. At Gigafactory Texas, we began production of the Cybertruck 
and delivered the first units to customers. We expect the ramp of Cybertruck to be 
longer than other models given its manufacturing complexity.
China: Shanghai
Shanghai resumed normal rate production in Q4, rebounding from the scheduled 
downtime in Q3. Production of the updated Model 3 ramped to full speed in less 
than two months.
Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg
Model Y production in Berlin continued to grow in Q4, achieving both a record

Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware
In Q4, we released our latest FSD Beta software (V12) to select Tesla employees,  
and more recently, to customers. V12 utilizes end -to-end training, enhancing the 
driving experience. We also introduced the 2nd generation of the Optimus robot, 
which uses Tesla- designed actuators and sensors and improved AI capabilities. 
Both FSD Beta and Optimus are trained with similar technology pillars: real -world 
data, neural net training and cutting -edge  hardware and software.
Vehicle and Other Software
We delivered the Cybertruck with an all -new user interface and new communication 
bus, Etherloop, that efficiently moves data while significantly reducing wiring. As 
part of our holiday update, when parking, Tesla vehicles without ultrasonic sensors display a high- fidelity 3D rendering of the vehicle's surroundings, including nearby 
barriers, vehicles and painted markings. Wireless Bluetooth headphones can also 
now be paired with the rear screen when watching shows or playing games. 
FleetAPI now enables third -party solutions that enhance integration and 
management of Tesla devices.
Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing
Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially to slightly above $36,000. 
Even as we approach the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup, 
our team continues to focus on further cost reductions across all points of production, from raw materials to final delivery.$34,000$35,000$36,000$37,000$38,000$39,000$40,000

Energy Storage
Energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q4 to 3.2 GWh, for a total 
deployment of 14.7 GWh in 2023, a 125% increase compared to 2022. While we expect deployments will continue to be volatile on a sequential basis, impacted by logistics and the global distribution of projects at any given time, we expect continued growth on a trailing twelve -month basis going forward. We continue to 
ramp our 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity. 
Solar
Solar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 41 MW. Downward pressure on solar demand continued into Q4 as interest rates have remained high.
Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower deployments and 
seasonal weakness in solar energy generation.
Services and Other business
The Services and Other business continued to grow alongside our fleet in 2023, achieving record revenue and gross profit generation. The biggest drivers of profit generation in 2023 were part sales, used vehicle sales, merchandise sales and pay -
per-use supercharging. As our fleet continues to expand in the coming years, there 
is an opportunity for fleet -related services to become a more meaningful driver of 
profit generation.Energy Storage deployments (GWh)0246810121416

12Volume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the 
Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next -generation vehicle 
platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our 
teams work on the launch of the next -generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas. In 2024, the growth rate of deployments 
and revenue in our Energy Storage business should outpace the Automotive business.
Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. 
Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect 
our hardware -related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits.
Product Cybertruck production and deliveries will ramp throughout this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our 
next generation platform.P H O T O S   &   C H A R T S

(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as 
well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP  financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information 
internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial 
condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s 
performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding 
Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.

$1.5B non -GAAP net income1 in Q1We experienced numerous challenges in Q1, from the Red Sea conflict and the 
arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, to the gradual ramp of the updated Model 3 in 
Fremont. Excluding Cybertruck and unscheduled downtime, our COGS4 per unit 
declined sequentially, driven primarily by lower raw material costs.
Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids 
over EVs. While positive for our regulatory credits business, we prefer the industry 
to continue pushing EV adoption, which is in -line with our mission. To support our 
growth, we have been increasing  awareness and expanding vehicle financing 
programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.
While many are pulling back on their investments, we are investing in future growth 
– including our AI infrastructure, production capacity, our Supercharger and service 
networks and new products infrastructure  – with $2.8B of capital expenditures in 
Q1. 
We recently undertook a cost -cutting exercise to increase operational efficiency. 
We also remain committed to company -wide cost reduction, including reducing 
COGS per vehicle. Ultimately, we are focused on profitable growth, including by 
leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more 
affordable products.
The future is not only electric, but also autonomous. We believe scaled autonomy is 
only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster. 
We have, and continue to expand, both. To make FSD (Supervised) 5 more 
accessible, we reduced the price of subscription to $99/month and the purchase 
price to $8,000 in the US.Cash Operating cash flow of $0.2B in Q1

5Revenue Total revenue declined 9% YoY in Q1 to $21.3B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
- reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) YoY (excl. FX impact), including unfavorable impact of mix
- decline in vehicle deliveries, partially due to the Model 3 update in the Fremont factory and Giga Berlin production 
disruptions
- negative FX impact of $0.2B1
+ growth in other parts of the business
+ higher FSD revenue recognition YoY due to release of Autopark feature in North America 
Profitability Our operating income decreased YoY to $1.2B in Q1, resulting in a 5.5% operating margin. YoY, operating income was 
primarily impacted by the following items:
- reduced vehicle ASP due to pricing and mix
- increase in operating expenses partly driven by AI, cell advancements and other R&D projects
- cost of Cybertruck production ramp
- decline in vehicle deliveries, partially due to the Model 3 update in the Fremont factory and Giga Berlin production 
disruptions
+ lower cost per vehicle, including lower raw material costs, freight and duties
+ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage including IRA credit benefit
+ higher FSD revenue recognition YoY due to release of Autopark feature in North America 
Cash Quarter -end cash, cash equivalents and investments in Q1 was $26.9B. The sequential decrease of $2.2B was a result of 
negative free cash flow of $2.5B, driven by an inventory increase of $2.7B and AI infrastructure capex of $1.0B in Q1.

A sequential decline in volumes was partially caused by the early phase of the 
production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin resulting from shipping diversions caused by the 
Red Sea conflict and from an arson attack.
US: California, Nevada and Texas
Model 3 production in Fremont was down sequentially as we changed the 
production line to the updated model. Sequentially, Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas increased to an all- time high, while COGS per unit improved to 
an all -time low. The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, 
with a sequential cost improvement in Q1. We produced over 1,000 Cybertrucks in a 
single week in April.
China: Shanghai
Production at Gigafactory Shanghai was down sequentially due to seasonality and planned shutdowns around Chinese New Year in Q1. Demand typically improves 
throughout the year. As we enter new markets, such as Chile, many of them will be 
supplied from Gigafactory Shanghai.
Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg
Model Y production in Berlin was down sequentially due to impacts from the Red 
Sea conflict and the arson attack that impacted the factory. Despite idle capacity 
charges and other costs from production disruptions, COGS per unit continued to 
decline sequentially.0%1%2%3%4%US/Canada Europe China0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4

Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware
We have been investing in the hardware and software ecosystems necessary to 
achieve vehicle autonomy and a ride- hailing service. We believe a scalable and 
profitable autonomy business can be realized through a vision -only architecture 
with end- to-end neural networks, trained on billions of miles of real- world data. 
Since the launch of FSD (Supervised) V12 earlier this year, it has become clear that this architecture long pursued by Tesla is the right solution for scalable autonomy. To further improve our end- to-end training capability, we will continue to increase 
our core AI infrastructure capacity in the coming months. In Q1, we completed the transition to Hardware 4.0, our latest in -vehicle computer with increased inference 
processing power and improved cameras.
Vehicle and Other Software
We rolled out FSD (Supervised) with a 30 -day free trial to eligible cars in U.S. and 
Canada. FSD (Supervised) can change lanes, select forks to follow routes, navigate 
around vehicles and objects and make turns. We released Autopark  to existing 
eligible FSD (Supervised) and Enhanced Autopilot customers. We are currently 
working on ride -hailing functionality that will be available in the future. We believe 
the Tesla software experience is best -in-class across all our products, and plan to 
seamlessly layer ride -hailing into the Tesla App.

9Energy Storage deployments (GWh)
Non-Automotive gross profit ($M)
01234Our non -automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla. 
As Megapack continues to ramp and as our fleet continues to grow, we are 
expecting consistent profit growth of our non -automotive business.
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy storage deployments increased sequentially in Q1 to a record 4.1 GWh. 
Energy Generation and Storage revenue and gross profit also achieved an all- time 
high in Q1. Revenues were up 7% YoY and gross profit was up 140% YoY, driven by 
increased Megapack deployments, partially offset by a decrease in solar 
deployments. Energy Generation and Storage remains our highest margin business. Our second general assembly line is now commissioned, and we continue to ramp our 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity.
Services and Other
Services and Other revenue grew 25% YoY in Q1, while gross profit was down 40% 
YoY. The biggest driver of gross profit reduction YoY was lower used vehicle profit, 
partially offset by growth in gross profit from part sales.
Starting at the end of February, we began opening our North American Supercharger Network to more non- Tesla EV owners. We will continue to onboard 
OEMs who have committed to NACS over the coming quarters, while also opening more sites to other EVs in regions outside North America, both of which should drive incremental revenue and profit generation.O U T L O O K
10Volume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 
3/Y platform and we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, 
including those built on our next generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably 
lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next generation vehicle and other 
products. In 2024, the growth rates of energy storage deployments and revenue in our Energy Generation and Storage 
business should outpace the Automotive business.
Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. 
Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect 
our hardware -related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits.
Product We have updated our future vehicle line -upto accelerate the launch ofnew models ahead of our previously 
communicated start of production in the second half of 2025.
These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
line-up. 
This update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected butenables us to prudently grow our 
vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This would help us fully utilize our current 
expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production 
before investing in new manufacturing lines. 
Our purpose -built robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy.P H O T O S   &   C H A R T S

WEBCAST  INFORMATION
Tesla will provide a live webcast of its first quarter 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on Ap ril 23, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year 
thereafter.
CERTAIN  TERMS
When  used  in this update,  certain  terms  have  the following  meanings.  Our vehicle  deliveries  include  only vehicles  that have  been  transferred  to end customers  with all paperwork  correctly  completed . Our energy  product  
deployment  volume  includes  both  customer  units  installed  and equipment  sales ; we report  installations  at time of commissioning  for storage  projects  or inspection  for solar  projects,  and equipment  sales  at time of delivery . 
"Adjusted  EBITDA" is equal  to (i) net income  (loss)  attributable  to common  stockholders  before  (ii)(a) interest  expense,  (b) provision  for income  taxes,  (c) depreciation,  amortization  and impairment  and (d) stock -based  
compensation  expense . "Free  cash  flow"  is operating  cash  flow less capital  expenditures . Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive  sales  divided by new vehicle  deliveries (excluding  operating  leases) . “Days  sales 
outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average accounts  receivable,  net for the period divided by (ii) total  revenues and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period. “Days  payable  outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average accounts  
payable  for the period divided by (ii) total  cost of revenues  and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period . “Days  of supply”  is calculated  by dividing  new car ending  inventory  by the relevant  quarter’s deliveries  and 
using  75 trading  days .Constant currency  impacts are calculated  by comparing  actuals against  current results converted  into USD using  average exchange rates  from  the prior period.
NON -GAAP  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non -GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non -GAAP financial measures include non -GAAP net income 
(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as 
well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP  financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information 
internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial 
condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important finan cial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s 
performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding 
Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non -GAAP financial information is provided above.
FORWARD -LOOKING  STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future developme nt, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, 
investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and 
statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward -looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are based on 
management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially f rom those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those in the forward -looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products a nd features cost -effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and 
charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and 
volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium- ion cells or other comp onents manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our
